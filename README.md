# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator

- This project is done with NumPy to find mean, variance standard deviation, min, max and sum values of a given a Python list length of 9. Calculate function turns that list to a NumPy array, calculates those values and then turns the outputs to list and items.
